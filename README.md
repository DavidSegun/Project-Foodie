# Project-Foodie
A Food Order App written in ReactJs
## Getting Started

- `npm`
- `npm init`
- `npm start`

In addition to compiling each package in watch mode, this will also spin up [packages/example](packages/example) on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Running Tests

- `npm test --watch`

## Documentation

This version of project-foodie is still in beta, so unfortunately documentation is pretty sparse at the moment. The [packages/example](packages/example), TSDoc comments, and the source itself are the best ways to get an idea of what's going on. More thorough documentation is a priority as development continues!
